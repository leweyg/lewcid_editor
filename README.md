# Lewcid Editor

Lewcid Editor is an adaptation of the three.js editor to run locally,
like a traditional file-based 3D editor, while maintining it's online capabilities.

Based on [three.js](https://threejs.org/)'s [editor source code](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)

## Features (ALL IN PROGRESS)
- **Browser-based 3D Editor**: most existing three.js editor features such 3D scene import/authoring/export (GLTF/OBJ/FBX/etc.) including models/lights/scripts etc.
- **'File / Open'** menu item Opens file on your local computer.
- **'File / Save'** menu item Opens file on your local computer.
- **'File / Explore or Code'** items like open in local file explorer or vscode.
- **'Folder tab'** to quick browse/open/instance large folders of files.


## Short term setup:
- Clone the git locally and run './editor_unix.sh' for Mac/Linux, or similar for Windows.

## Longer term:
- To be compiled into a standalone electron-type app to run natively on most platforms.
